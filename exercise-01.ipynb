    "Using the van der Waals equation, create a Python program to solve real gas parameters (pressure, molar volume, and temperature). Submit a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file with the following file name convention: [Course Code]_[Section]_Exercise_01_[Student Number]. Example: DS100-1_E01_Exercise_01_2024114901. Submit also screenshots of your code and output in Jupyter Notebook. If you have used generative AI tools (like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.), submit screenshots of how you have used them to create your Python program. Ensure you have improved the code generated by the AI Tool and not simply copied and pasted the code. Briefly discuss how you have improved the code generated by the AI Tool. Put all screenshots and the discussion in one document (PDF). Use the same file naming convention above for the PDF.\n",

    "In brief, the van der Waals equation, shown below (Eq. 1), is used in computing the pressure, temperature, and molar volume of gases that do not behave ideally.\n",

    "You can find the values of a and b in this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_constants_(data_page)). These values depend on the gases being used for the calculation. Pressure and Temperature can be calculated straightforwardly using the equation above. However, to calculate the Molar Volume (Vm), you will use an iterative method using the equation below (Eq. 2).\n",

    "Substitute the initial value of the molar volume (calculated using Eq. 3) on the right side of Eq. 2, and solve for the new value of V_m. Then, the new value of V_m is substituted on the right side of Eq. 2 until you achieve similar values of molar volume on both sides of the equation.\n",
